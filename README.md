# Coding Fundamentals

Coding Fundamentals from my perspective. Thats what i use in my projects.

## [Design Patterns]

Software design patterns are general reusable solutions to problems which occur
over and over again in object-oriented design enviroment. It is not a finished
design that can be transformed into source code directly, but it is template how
to solve the problem. We can classify them by purpose into creational (abstract
the instantiation process), structure (how classes and objects are composed to form
larger structures) and behavioral patterns (the assignment of responsibilities between
objects).

## [Algorithms]

An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions,
typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always
unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing,
automated reasoning, and other tasks.

## [Data Structures]

A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables
efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of
data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be
applied to the data.
