# Coding Fundamentals

Coding Fundamentals from my perspective. Thats what i use in my projects.

## [Linked Lists]

Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures.
They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types,
including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions,
though it is not uncommon to implement those data structures directly without
using a linked list as the basis.

## [Design Patterns]

Software design patterns are general reusable solutions to problems which occur
over and over again in object-oriented design enviroment. It is not a finished
design that can be transformed into source code directly, but it is template how
to solve the problem. We can classify them by purpose into creational (abstract
the instantiation process), structure (how classes and objects are composed to form
larger structures) and behavioral patterns (the assignment of responsibilities between
objects).
