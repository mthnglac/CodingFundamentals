# Coding Fundamentals

Coding Fundamentals from my perspective. Thats what i use in my projects.

## Design Patterns

Software design patterns are general reusable solutions to problems which occur
over and over again in object-oriented design enviroment. It is not a finished
design that can be transformed into source code directly, but it is template how
to solve the problem. We can classify them by purpose into creational (abstract
the instantiation process), structure (how classes and objects are composed to form
larger structures) and behavioral patterns (the assignment of responsibilities between
objects).
