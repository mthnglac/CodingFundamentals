# Coding Fundamentals

Coding Fundamentals from my perspective. Thats what i use in my projects.


## Typescript Design Patterns

Software design patterns are general reusable solutions to problems which occur
over and over again in object-oriented design enviroment. It is not a finished
design that can be transformed into source code directly, but it is template how
to solve the problem. We can classify them by purpose into creational (abstract
the instantiation process), structure (how classes and objects are composed to form
larger structures) and behavioral patterns (the assignment of responsibilities between
objects).

#### Creational Patterns

- [Singleton], the sole instance of a class
- [Factory], subclass of object that is instantiated
- [Abstract Factory], families of product objects
- [Builder], how a composite object gets created

#### Creational Patterns
- [Chain of Responsibility], object that can fulfill a request

#### Behavioral Patterns
- [Command], when and how a request is fulfilled
- [Iterator], how an aggregate's elements are accessed
- [Memento], what private information is stored outside an object, and when
