## [Binary Search]

Binary search works on sorted arrays. Binary search begins by comparing an
element in the middle of the array with the target value. If the target value
matches the element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value
is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array.
If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper
half of the array. By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the
target value cannot lie in each iteration.

## [Quicksort]

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot'
element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays,
according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The
sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring
small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
