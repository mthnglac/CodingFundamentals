## Typescript Design Patterns

This list shows the patterns and solutions that I have implemented on typescript.
The way of writing the code is completely subjective; Try to grab something, that's enough,
my goal is to be useful to you.

#### Creational Patterns

- [Singleton], the sole instance of a class
- [Factory], subclass of object that is instantiated
- [Abstract Factory], families of product objects
- [Builder], how a composite object gets created

#### Creational Patterns

- [Chain of Responsibility], object that can fulfill a request

#### Behavioral Patterns

- [Command], when and how a request is fulfilled
- [Iterator], how an aggregate's elements are accessed
- [Memento], what private information is stored outside an object, and when
