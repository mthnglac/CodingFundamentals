## Typescript Design Patterns

This list shows the patterns and solutions that I have implemented on
typescript.  The way of writing the code is completely subjective; Try to grab
something, that's enough, my goal is to be useful to you.

#### Creational Patterns

- [Singleton], the sole instance of a class
- [Factory], subclass of object that is instantiated
- [Abstract Factory], families of product objects
- [Builder], how a composite object gets created
- [Dependency Injection], technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on.

#### Structural Patterns

- [Adapter], interface to an object
- [Bridge], implementation of an object
- [Composite], structure and composition of an object
- [Decorator], responsibilities of an object without subclassing
- [Facade], interface to a subssystem
- [Flyweight], storage consts of objects

#### Behavioral Patterns

- [Chain of Responsibility], object that can fulfill a request
- [Command], when and how a request is fulfilled
- [Interpreter], grammar and interpretation of a language
- [Iterator], how an aggregate's elements are accessed
- [Mediator], how and which objects interact with each other
- [Memento], what private information is stored outside an object, and when
- [Observer], how the dependent objects stay up to date
- [State], states of an object
- [Strategy], an algorithm
- [Template Method], steps of an algorithm
- [Visitor], operations that can be applied to objects without changing their classes
