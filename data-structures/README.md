## [Linked Lists]

Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures.
They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types,
including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions,
though it is not uncommon to implement those data structures directly without
using a linked list as the basis.

## [Trees]

A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of
nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting
of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"),
with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.
